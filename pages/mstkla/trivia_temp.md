**Trivia**

How to pronounce MSTKLA?

Well.....\
MSTKLA is the precursor to MSTK. It is hoped that the underlying
structure of MSTK will be all new code independent of LaGriT. However,
since we are using LaGriT as the underlying structure for now, the
toolkit is called MSTKLA.

M-S-T-K rolls off the tongue nicely, not so M-S-T-K-L-A. Therefore,
judging by the people's first reaction to the name (the second reaction
is Blechhhch!!), why not pronounce it as *misticlaa*?

P.S.: Sorry, I am lousy at christening pieces of code!! Just take a look
at my API...\
