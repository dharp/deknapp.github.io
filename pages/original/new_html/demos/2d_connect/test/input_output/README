NOTE: When trying to do this example substituting 
read/gmv for read/avs there is a problem in defining
the topology of the the cmo as 2-d: using cmo/status
the read/avs version has nsdtopo=2, whereas the read/gmv
has nsdtopo=3.

This occurs even though the gmv file was originally created
using read/avs - dump/gmv.

At first glance in read_gmv_binary... there might be a problem
in that there is no case for 0 elements data structures (i.e.
point sets).
