This merges student Mikita V3.106 WIN development with master.\
Mikita comments and updates to mercurial/trac repository include:

-   **test**\
    Added top level python control suite, and standarized level02 output
    files.
-   **build windows**\
    The windows version of LaGrit is compiled using cygwin by Mikita.
    See files instructions.txt (copied to build\_win.txt), and
    cmake-script.
-   **build static**\
    The static version of LaGrit is compiled on Ubuntu by Mikita.
    Instructions Ubuntu are not written, however the instructions
    written for Windows static compilation using Cygwin are almost
    exactly as they are for Ubuntu.
-   **lg\_util library**\

[]{#Release_V3.106}

LaGriT V3.106 August 2015
-------------------------

Major update to write PFLOTRAN type option stor file and new syntax
using Exodus II 6.9 libraries.\
This version is used for code development by summer student Mikita Yanki
that includes changes and scripts to build LaGriT on windows with Exodus
II V6 libraries. This is a branch that does not include some of the
V3.107 updates. Mikita's version is merged and contained in the V3.2
release.

*Note: The LaGriT run-time banner shows V3.2 with compile date Aug 2015,
even though it is actually a branch from V3.106.*

Major updates include:

-   **dump / pflotran**\
    Writes .uge file for pflotran and is used by the DFN suite of
    scripts. The first block are the list of ids of cells and the
    coordinates of cell centroids and the volumes of the cells. The
    second block consists of a list of ids of the connecting cells
    (id\_up, id\_dn), coordinates of the face centroid between the two
    connected cells and areas of the faces.\
    Test directory is in /n/swdev/LAGRIT/work/pflotran/test along with
    upper directory with dev work.\
    The routines are called from matbld 2D and 3D and use the same
    syntax as dump/stor and look like:

            dump / pflotran / root_name / cmo_name
            dump / pflotran / root_name / cmo_name / nofilter_zero

-   **dump / exo**\
    New code syntax using ExodusII 6.09, LaGriT commands remain the
    same.

           http://sourceforge.net/projects/exodusii/files/
           Exodus II 6.09
           HDF5 version 1.8.6
           netcdf-4.1.3

-   **exo block id** modified to single digit.\
    All exodus files are same as Exodus II 5, except for the block id.
    Tests have been updated resulting in the following differences:

        Exodus 6.09:
        <               :api_version = 6.09f ;
        <               :version = 6.09f ;
        ---
        <  eb_prop1 = 1, 2, 3 ;

        Exodus 5.22a:
        >               :api_version = 5.22f ;
        >               :version = 5.22f ;
        ---
        >  eb_prop1 = 10000, 20000, 30000 ;

Minor updates to master version include:

-   **attribute compress\_eps**\
    new attribute for stor file allowing user to extend range of ccoef
    values by setting mesh attribute compress\_eps (from default 1e-8).
    This will keep connection regardless of coefficient value. Changing
    value of compress\_epsilon seemed to help loss of coeffs with large
    aspect ratios.
-   **dump / stor (2D)**\
    Corrected bug that overwrites volic with incorrect value if grid is
    non-planer.
-   **dump / fehm**\
    add space between ns and nelements, increase to i12
-   **read / fehm**\
    Fixed seg fault for 0 elem report message by using a,a instead of a
    format.
-   **build exodus libs**\
    The following is a list of issues when dealing with building static
    libraries for exodus and its compilation.

        Library inclusion order in the following places:
        1. /n/swdev/src/exodusii/exodus-6.09/exodus/cbind/CMakeList.txt 
            Line 284
        2. /n/swdev/src/exodusoo/exodus-6.09/exodus/forbind/CMakeList.txt
            Line 62
        Solution was to switch ${HDF5_LIBRARY} with ${HDF5HL_LIBRARY}

    These are the external libs used with LaGriT V3.1 As of November 2012
       http://sourceforge.net/projects/exodusii/files/
         Exodus II 5.22a
         HDF5 version 1.8.6
         netcdf-4.1.3

    Linux RHEL Exodus 5 libraries were built in
     /n/swdev/LAGRIT/VERS_3.100_012_NOV09/build_lagrit/exodus

    Build executable for linux:
    gfortran -O -Dlinx64 -static -fcray-pointer -fdefault-integer-8 -fno-sign-zero -o mylagrit lagrit_main.o lagrit_fdate.o lagrit_lin64_o_gf4.5.a /n/swdev/LAGRIT/VERS_3.100_012_NOV09/build_lagrit/lg_util/lib/util_lin64_o_gfort4.5.a -L /n/swdev/LAGRIT/VERS_3.100_012_NOV09/build_lagrit/exodus/lin64/lib -lexoIIv2for -lexodus -lnetcdf -lhdf5_hl -lhdf5 -lz -lm -lstdc++

This release include the following enhancements:

-   **read / zonezone\_element /**
    <div>

    Added option zone\_element which allows reading of node or element
    list in FEHM zone or zonn format. Each node or element number found
    in the list has attribute tagged.

    

This release include the following fixes:

-   **\#105: addatt/ mo\_tri / unit\_area\_normal**
    <div>

    Fixed incorrect zero result and fixed attribute handling so vector
    array is formed using irank = 3.

    

-   **\#108: cmo/addatt/mo/area\_normal/xyz/att\_v\_area**
    <div>

    Result is off by factor of 2, fixed area normal to assign half the
    cross product (for triangles).

    

-   **\#132: synth\_norm**
    <div>

    Fixed handling of attributes. The synthetic normals were creating a
    dummy attribute not used because offsetsurf is creating x\_n\_norm
    y\_n\_norm z\_n\_norm on the input cmo. Attribute names are ignored
    on the command line, added better reporting for this.

[]{#Release_V3.100}

LaGriT V3.100 November 2012
---------------------------

Major changes to most parts of the code to enable 64 bit compilation and
added external Exodus II 5 libraries to write Exodus basic mesh files.
These are the external libs used with this release:

A few minor changes/fixes include: cmo/copyatt fix copy from node
attribute to elem attribute of equal length. cmo/readatt fix to allow
char in first position. Memory and bug fixes related to 64 bit code
changes. Improved error catching for common routines.

### Command Enhancements

-   **dump / exo**
    <div>

    Now includes netcdf and exodus libs for writing exodus mesh files
    and reading and writing facesets.
        Syntax:
          dump / exo / ifile / cmoname

          Dump exodus files with/without facesets, fast/slow options:
          dump / exo / ifile / cmoname / facesets / on
          dump / exo / ifile / cmoname / facesets / off
          dump / exo / ifile / cmoname / facesets / on file1,file2,...filen
          dump / exo / ifile / cmoname / facesets / off file1,file2,...filen

          write exo pset and eltsets:
          dump / exo / filenam.exo / cmoname / psets / eltsets /
          dump/exo/mesh_07.exo/mo7//eltsets/ &
             facesets bc01.faceset &
             bc02.faceset bc03.faceset bc04.faceset &
             bc05.faceset bc08.faceset bc09.faceset

    <div>

    3 token short syntax for dump (avs,gmv,lg,lagrit,ts,exo)

    

-   **extract/surfmesh**
    <div>

    Now creates attributes to hold element local face numbers of 3D
    input mesh that occur on either side of output mesh face, idface0
    and idface1. Now copies user-created node-based attributes from
    source.

    

-   **interpolate**
    <div>

    Changed interpolate to "find" more points on edges this will permit
    nodes to find a nearest edge or point and be "inside" the triangle
    for extreme small or large numbers where epsilon values are
    difficult to evaluate correctly.

    

-   **massage**
    <div>

    Added option for massage to refine based on an attribute field.
        Syntax:
          massage / [bisection length/field name] / merge_length / toldamage / ...

    

-   **massage2**
    <div>

    Under development massage2 syntax for incremental refinement
    strategies.
        Syntax:
          massage2/ [file name] / [Target Length Scale]/[field name]/ &
             merge_length/toldamage/[tolroughness]/[ifirst,ilast,istride]/ ...

    

-   **math**
    <div>

    add modulo and mod options

    

-   **recon**
    <div>

    Code improvements related to recon 0 and recon 1 will result in
    slightly different but better connectivity results.

    

-   **sort**
    <div>

    Added line sort by nodes or elements for creating valid polygons
    that can be read and used by other routines.
        Syntax:
          sort / line_graph / cmo / ascending  descending / [key] / [nodes/elements]

[]{#Release_V3.001}

LaGriT V3.001 August 2011
-------------------------

Major changes incoporating work from Andrew Kuprat (64bit work) and
summer student Adam Cozzette to add more capability. Changes to make
64bit code more consistent and easier to modify for various platforms.
The code for stack routines are combined into stack\_options.f from
temptam.f and read\_trilayers.f. The beads algorithm and routines are
now all in their own file beads\_ona\_ring.f\
\
LaGriT assumes that the size of an integer is the same size as a
pointer. Use the preprocessor and configure settings to select the
integer type so that it matches the size of a pointer.

    #if SIZEOF_INT == SIZEOF_VOIDP
    #define int_ptrsize int
    #elif SIZEOF_LONG == SIZEOF_VOIDP
    #define int_ptrsize long

    Makefile changes for 64 bit compile:
      -fcray-pointer
    Enables the Cray pointer extension, which provides a C-like pointer

    -falign-commons (will try to reorder commons so this is not needed)
    By default, gfortran enforces proper alignment of all variables in a COMMON block by padding them as needed. On certain platforms this is mandatory, on others it increases performance. If a COMMON block is not declared with consistent data types everywhere, this padding can cause trouble, and -fno-align-commons can be used to disable automatic alignment. The same form of this option should be used for all files that share a COMMON block. To avoid potential alignment issues in COMMON blocks, it is recommended to order objects from largests to smallest.

Andrew Kuprat changes:

\

Adam Cozzette changes:

-   anothermatbld3d.c

            - added several functions for computing the hybrid point of a control volume:
              tetisOnBoundary, intersectSegmentWithFace, getHybridPoint
            - added helper functions for computing dot products and distances.
            - changed the areaOf3dTriangle function to compute a vector area rather than a scalar.
            - a change computes a unit vector in the direction of an edge between
              two points in the tetrahedral mesh. We dot this with the facet of the Voronoi
              cell in order to consider just the component of the area that is in the
              direction of the edge.
            - changed the parameter list for initialize3ddiffusionmat_ so that the
              function also takes arrays for jtet, pmbndry, ifhybrid, and hybridfactor.
              ifhybrid indicates whether to use hybrid volumes and hybrid_factor is an
              attribute that the function will fill in order to indicate the extent to which
              each cell is hybridized
            - added function prototypes so that gcc can perform type checking
            - added #if to match format string to size of integers being used

-   anothermatbld3d\_wrapper.f

            - changed subroutine call to add hybrid_factor
                     subroutine anothermatbld3d_wrapper
        -     x           (ifile,io_type,num_area_coef,ifcompress)
        +     x           (ifile,io_type,num_area_coef,ifcompress, ifhybrid)

-   cmo\_addatt.f

            - added the hybrid_volume to the cmo // addatt command
            - added a metric for quad quality  cmo // addatt / quad_quality

-   connect2d\_lg.f

            - fix bug in 2D delaunay connect where the code
              doubled the coordinates of the first Voronoi point

-   cr\_copy.f

            - fixed an off-by-one error by making an array one element longer
              in a call to mmgetblk with length + 1
              this was causing segfault errors

-   dumpfehm.f

            - changed subroutine call to add hybrid_factor
               subroutine dumpfehm(ifile,ifileini,ioption,iomode,
        -     *       area_coef_option,compress_opt,attrib_option,area_option)
        +     *       area_coef_option,compress_opt,attrib_option,area_option,
        +     *       hybrid_option)

-   eset.f

            - Added support for writing element sets out to a file based on pset logic
              changed the behavior so that eltset // write will write each element set
              to a separate file if it is given the -all- option
              filenames now end with .cellset
            - fixed a bug where attempting to redefine an element set, the set is now
              zeroed out and written afresh

-   geniee.f

            - changed loop to check condition before starting, this avoids
              writing to memory is invalid

-   intersect\_cmo.f

            - added sort // line_graph after performing the intersection
            - fixed loop that was looping wrong number of times
              changed 1,npointsa to 1,npoint

-   pcc\_test.f

            - fixed Warning so it is given once instead of once for every element

-   pset.F

            - changed pset to verify a point before writing to file
            - added the -all- option that writes each pset to seperate files
              with the new file extension .vertexset

-   quality.f

            - Added support for quad metrics in quality / quad

-   reorder.f

            - fixed reorder so that it doesn't rely on the numerical values
              to determine whether to sort nodes or elements
            - added messages to indicate possible WARNINGS for reorder

-   rotatelo.f

            - Fixed a bug whereby rotateln would rotate some points in one
              direction and some points in the opposite direction.

-   sortbins.f

            - Added support for sort // line_graph. line_graph_sort.cpp does most of the
              real work. I also had to fix this subroutine to create the sort keys correctly.
              Previously it used an integer length to decide whether to use 'nnodes' or
              'nelements', but now it is careful to choose based on whether it is actually
              sorting nodes or elements.

-   sparseMatrix.c

            - removed unused variables in order to get rid of compiler warnings
            - added #if for printf to use string according to integer size

-   writedump.f

            - changes to facilitate the 'hybrid' option and Rao's new dump / exo code

 built and manipulated will be greatly expanded.\

 Changed FEHM outside area calculation to default to Voronoi area      
 associated with nodes of a 3D tetrahedral mesh instead of computing   
 Median area. FEHM file file\_root\_outside.area changed to            
 file\_root\_outside\_vor.area For dump/zone, added keywords           
 keepatt\_area or keepatt\_voronoi which will compute and keep voronoi 
 vector areas xn\_varea, yn\_varea, zn\_varea and keepatt\_median will 
 compute area/num nodes on face and keep attributes xn\_area,          
 yn\_area, zn\_area The written file file\_root\_outside\_vor.area or  
 file\_name\_outside\_med.area is a list of 2D area vectors            
 (Ax\_i,Ay\_i,Az\_i) associated with each node.

 This module will do the same voronoi calculation on triangles as is   
 done with the outside area for a 3D tetrahderal mesh. The call will   
 create vector components for each node and fill the node attributes   
 xn\_varea, yn\_varea, zn\_varea.

 Now creates attributes to hold element local face numbers of 3D input 
 mesh that occur on either side of output mesh face, idface0 and       
 idface1. Now copies user-created node-based attributes from source    
 mesh into extracted sink mesh.

 excavate - remove nodes and elements if they fall with the            
 circumsphere of triangles on the input mesh.\                         
 \                                                                     
 mesh1 must be a 3D mesh (of any geometry) and mesh2 must be a 2D      
 triangular mesh. This command then excavates a volume in mesh1 around 
 mesh2, such that the surface could then be inserted into the 3D mesh  
 (such as to insert a fault into a background terrain mesh). The       
 background mesh, minus the excavated/removed nodes, is put into       
 mesh3. If the optional \[bfs\] argument is given, the routine will    
 use a breadth-first search algorithm to find nodes to remove, as      
 opposed to the default KD-tree algorithm. If the optional \[connect\] 
 argument is given, the program will, after excavation, execute an     
 addmesh/append, and then a connect, to produce a fully connected mesh 
 with the surface (mesh2) inserted into the background (mesh1).

 Changed interpolate to "find" more points on edges this will permit   
 nodes to find a nearest edge or point and be "inside" the triangle    
 for extreme small or large numbers where epsilon values are difficult 
 to evaluate correctly. Note, this changed test results for            
 interpolate, test/level01 results were updated for these              
 improvements. <https://lagrit.lanl.gov/docs/main_interpolate.html>\   
 \

 A bug was fixed in interpolation that would sometimes save a node id  
 in pt\_gtg or el\_gtg attributes that was not related to the found    
 candidate and value. This could occur where there are multiple        
 candidates for the source and if epsilon values are near machine      
 limits. The test in level01/intrp\_2D\_sizes was changed to capture   
 and evaluate these issues.\                                           
 \                                                                     
 intrp\_gtg.f, inside\_lg.f\                                           
 There are changes to interpolate using tests for finding points that  
 are inside or on edges or vertices of an element. The epsilon tests   
 have been relaxed to allow points that are "near" to be found on edge 
 - if within the chosen epsilon. The interpolation has been changed to 
 evaluate candidate points based on the confidence of being inside the 
 associated triangle. A result indicating the point is inside will     
 "win" over a candidate result that is on edge or vertice. If idebug   
 attribute is set to a number of 5 or greater, there will be many more 
 statements written that are related to the inside triangle and        
 epsilon tests.\

 linear\_extrapolate - keyword for an extrapolation from an attribute  
 value in a surface onto every node of a 3D mesh. Given a 3D mesh and  
 a 2D surface, this command will extrapolate a scalar value from that  
 surface onto every point of the mesh. This can be used to (for        
 example):\

[]{#Release_V2.100}

LaGriT V2.100 August 2009
-------------------------

This is a major update to LaGriT and the lg\_util library. Major changes
have been made in the core memory management routines to allow
development for a 64 bit release. These changes will be invisible to
most users but allows better reporting of errors and memory usage for
useful diagnostic information.\
Other changes include:

Executable build for Mac with Intel chip

New capability in compute module to compute signed distance fields

Incorporate METIS source code for graph partition and reorder package
with LaGriT.\
For details of METIS algorithms and descriptions of the third command
line argument see: http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/views/metis

Add option to create node attribute that is the Voronoi volume
associated with each node of a Delaunay mesh

Module addmesh modified to handle errors so that it can be used in a
loop without needing to have first call be different

Updates stor file commands so default uses newest version of code to
build sparse matrix. This uses less memory and takes less time to
build.\
New syntax options for stor file compression include all (default),
graph, coefs, or none.

Update manual and web pages

Bug fix, various modules
