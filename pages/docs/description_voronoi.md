interpolate / voronoi
---------------------

\
\
Example 1: show results from using the **voronoi** (nearest node) option
of interpolate.\
\

> For each point in the sink grid, the nearest node is found from the
> source or background grid. The attribute value associated with the
> sink point is assigned the attribute value from the source node.

> The output consists of GMV files.

> The input consists of AVS and GMV files. The input deck for this
> example is [LaGriT\_input\_voronoi](lagrit_input_voronoi)

\
\
Results from Example 1:\
\

> The objective is to test the ability of **interpolate** to find the
> nearest node in a coarse hex grid to each point of a refined triangle
> grid. The imt value of each found node is copied to the sink imt
> attribute. Image shows the imt colors of the coarse hex grid and the
> refined triangle sink grid.

> The objective is to test the ability of **interpolate** to find the
> nearest node in a quad grid and copy imt values to sink quad grid.
> Image shows both the irregular quad grid and the refined quad sink
> grid.
