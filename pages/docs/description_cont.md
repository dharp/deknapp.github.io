interpolate / continuous
------------------------

\
\
Example 3: show results from using the **continuous** option of
interpolate.\
\

> For each point in the sink grid, the enclosing element is found from
> the source grid. The attribute value associated with the sink point is
> assigned the interpolated attribute values from the element nodes.
> WARNING! continuous interpolation from a hex is not supported. Use
> hextotet to convert the source grid.

> The output consists of GMV files.

> The input consists of AVS and GMV files. The input deck for this
> example is [LaGriT\_input\_continuous](lagrit_input_continuous)

\
\
Results from Example 3:\
\

> The objective is to test the ability of **interpolate** to use
> **continuous** interpolation from source element vertices on to sink
> points.\
> Image on left shows the source tet grid and location of the sink hex
> element in the lower left corner of the tet grid. Values from the
> enclosing tet nodes are interpolated on to each hex point based on the
> point's location in the found source element.\
> The image on the right is the sink hex element with the interpolated
> values written to node attribute called xval.

> The objective is use the **continuous** method to interpolate node

> Image on the left shows the source triangles colored by the node
> attribute numreal.\
> Image on the right shows the sink quad grid with the interpolated
> values at the quad nodes. As seen by this image, the sink grid does
> not extend as high as the source grid, and has nodes outside the
> source grid. These nodes are flagged with the dark red values.
